<br>and tripleamaps and client map download.
<br>Last update: 2020-01-27, v1.0.2
<br>Game engine 1.9.0.0 required.
<br>
<h2>========== KNOWN ENGINE PROBLEMS ==========

</h2>Due that transport engine is in development, correct
<br>transporting has to be checked manually.
<br>Regarding Airtransport and Landtransport, see Unit Rules.
<br>
<h2>================= RULES ===================

</h2>Rules of v3 and technology extensions apply.

<br>
<br>FUEL CONSUMPTION for vehicle production+movement is used.
<br>
<br>Territory effect is used in urban areas for Infantry, Paratrooper, Armour, ...

<br>
<h2>---(1)-------- Construction and Demolition Rules ------------

<br>
<h2>================= SPECIAL RULES SUMMARY ===================

</h2>Due that not all features are supported by the triplea engine, some rules have to be checked manually !!!
<br>
<br>---- Generally v3 rules apply, exception is that transport ships behave like normal ships as losses.
<br>
<br>--- Due that a land transport engine is not in place for triplea, landtransport has to be checked manually.
<br>Landtransport and Halftrack transport ONLY: Infantry, Paratrooper, Artillery, Defense.
<br>Train transports ALL Landunits, but only in NOT just captured territories.
<br>
<br>---- Airtransport ONLY in combat Paratrooper, in noncombat Infantry, Paratrooper, Defense, Recruit.
<br>
<br>---- Only from Landingboat amphibious attacks, Seatransport and Cruiser unload at occupied territory.
<br>Artillery, Bigarmour, Katyusha, AAGun can not attack amphibious.
<br>
<br>---- SBR done to Train, Construction, Bunker, Vehicle, Aircraft, Shipyard,
<br>Refinery, Radar, Airbase and Factories.
<br>SBR done to Destroyer, Cruiser, Carrier, BigCarrier, Battleship, SeaTransport, LandingBoat.
<br>SBR can also be done to planes (destroy them on the ground), if they were NOT intercepting !!!
<br>
<br>---- Defense unit can not move alone, has to be transported.
<br>
<br>---- To place units you need generally a Factory AND (Vehicle OR Aircraft OR Shipyard) AND Recruits.
<br>Combat units WITH fuel need any Factory AND (Vehicle OR Aircraft OR Shipyard) AND Recruit.
<br>Combat units WITHOUT fuel need ONLY any Factory AND Recruits.
<br>NonCombat units like Landtransport, Train, Construction need any Factory and NO Recruits.
<br>
<br>---- Demolition after turn end, captureable units, e.g. Train,
<br>Vehicle, Aircraft, Shipyard, Factory, Refinery, Radar, Airbase can be destroyed.
<br>Useful at a retreat to leave nothing behind to capture.
<br>Done manually with edit.
<br>NOTE: At any time structures also from an ally can be demolished.
<br>e.g. Airbase after all allied planes have left.
<br>NOTE: In same round captured structures are NOT allowed to destroy.
<br>It makes no sense to add/remove an Oilfield with edit, its only a symbol.
<br>
<h2>============== CONNECTIONS =============

</h2>Bosperus: Istanbul to Ankara no land connection, only by sea.
<br>Bosperus channel is open.
<br>Suez and Panama channel.
