<br>c.) General tips:
<br>Due to the wide range of possibilities its more a game for experienced players (typical rounds 20).
<br>Specially the supply strategy is crucial for this mod with air+sea+land transport units.
<br>The combination of all possible features enables almost a real handling of warfare.
<br>The fuel mod opens a totally new strategy setup. Big unit groups can't move forever, so use your fuel wisely.
